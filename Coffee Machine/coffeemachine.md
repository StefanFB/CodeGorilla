This will be the directory of the Coffee Machine project!

## Stage 1
### Objective

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

Sample output:
``` 
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
```

## Stage 2
### Objectives

1. First, read the numbers of coffee drinks from the input.
2. Figure out how much of each ingredient the machine will need. Note that one cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans.
3. Output the required ingredient amounts back to the user.

Sample output:
```
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 25
For 25 cups of coffee you will need:
5000 ml of water
1250 ml of milk
375 g of coffee beans
```

## Stage 3
### Objectives

Write a program that does the following:

1. It requests the amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available at the moment, and then asks for the number of cups a user needs.
2. If the coffee machine has enough supplies to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should print `"Yes, I can make that amount of coffee"`.
3. If the coffee machine can make more than that, the program should output `"Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even N more than that)"`, where N is the number of additional cups of coffee that the coffee machine can make.
4. If the amount of given resources is not enough to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should output `"No, I can make only N cups of coffee"`.

Example output:
```
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 1550
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 299
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 300
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 3
Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even 2 more than that)
```
