# ConnectFour
Tired of playing Tic-Tac-Toe? Want something a little more challenging? Connect Four is a great game that fuses the complexity of a larger game board and the need to line up more pieces. In this project, you will create a version of the game with a graphical user interface that you can run on your computer.

## Learning Outcomes
Learn about multidimensional arrays, a variety of loops, and how to utilize Java Swing library to create a user interface. Write a complicated algorithm to check the game board for a winning condition after each turn and highlight the winning move.

## Stage 1
### Objectives

Your program should display an empty game board as described below.

* The main `ConnectFour` class should extend the `JFrame` class, set its title as Connect Four, and exit on close;
* The cells should extend the `JButton` class. Hint: Set the painted focus to `false` to remove the highlighting on the clicked cells;
* Create 6 rows and 7 columns on the board;
* Each cell should be visible and display the row and column as its label. For example, `A1`, `G6`;
* Each cell should be named `Button**` where `**` is the row and column designation in the label;
* Organize rows and columns as shown in the example below.

## Stage 2
### Objectives

In this stage, your program should:

* Display an empty game board, where each cell displays a single space "` `" as its label;
* When a player clicks on a cell, change that cell's label to either `X` or `O` depending on the turn, starting with `X`.

---

## Stage 3
### Objectives

In this stage your program should:

* Fill the cells according to the rule above â€” not by the position of the click but by the column that was clicked on;
* Continue to alternate between the `X` and `O` pieces after each click.
