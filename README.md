# Projects for the CodeGorilla bootcamp

On February 13th 2023 I started the [CodeGorilla](https://codegorilla.nl/) bootcamp. In this repository I will keep track of my projects. The bootcamp will last for 16 weeks and will end with a larger project.

## 1 - Flashcards
The first project was to create a simple webpage showing flashcards. I learned how to do positioning with Flexbox and make animations with only CSS.

## 2 - Virtual Piano
The second project was to create a simple webpage showing some pianokeys. I learned how to let a sound play when a certain keyboard key is pressed, doing so with JS.

## 3 - To-Do List
In this project I created a simple to-do list webpage. You can add and remove tasks, and mark a task as done. The list is saved by the browser using localStorage in JSON format.
