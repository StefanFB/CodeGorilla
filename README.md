# Projects for the CodeGorilla bootcamp

On February 13th 2023 I started the [CodeGorilla](https://codegorilla.nl/) bootcamp. In this repository I will keep track of my projects. The bootcamp will last for 16 weeks and will end with a larger project.

## Frontend
In the first 3,5 weeks we learned frontend: HTML, CSS and JS. 

### 1 - Flashcards
The first project was to create a simple webpage showing flashcards. I learned how to do positioning with Flexbox and make animations with only CSS.

### 2 - Virtual Piano
The second project was to create a simple webpage showing some pianokeys. I learned how to let a sound play when a certain keyboard key is pressed, doing so with JS.

### 3 - To-Do List
In this project I created a simple to-do list webpage. You can add and remove tasks, and mark a task as done. The list is saved by the browser using localStorage in JSON format.

### 4 - Portfolio
Creating a simple portfolio webpage from scratch. Added a popup window in JS for each project on the page. 

### 5 - Open Space
Little animation of a rocket leaving a asteroid. To unlock the launch button, you have to type the correct password, check the correct checkboxes and place all levers in the right position.

### 6 - Coffee Machine (JS)
Little console program that let's you interact with a simple coffee machine interface. You can buy coffee, check the contents, refill the machine, empty the cash drawer and exit the program.

## Java Basics
The next 2 weeks we started with the basics of Java.

### 7 - Simple Chatty Bot (Java)
This small program will ask for your name, calculate your age after asking some questions, count up to a number you have inputted and asks you a multiple choice question.

### 8 Cinema Room Manager
This program will handle the buying and selling of tickets for a cinema room. It will set up the room with rows and seats, and afterwards you can show the current status of the room, buy tickets and show some statistics.

### 9 Coffee Machine (Java)
This program is similar to the JavaScript version (project 6), but the last assignment required to build the machine using enums. The input is processed according to the state of the machine.

### 10 Battleship
A terminal version of the famous battleship board game. This project is not yet finished, because we had to switch to the next track. I am planning to finish this project later.

## Java Advanced

### 11 - Connect Four
Learn about multidimensional arrays, a variety of loops, and how to utilize Java Swing library to create a user interface. Write a complicated algorithm to check the game board for a winning condition after each turn and highlight the winning move.

### 12 - Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Java)
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and methods, handling errors, and processing user input. You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.

### 13 - Cinema Room REST Service (Java)
In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.

### 14 - Car Sharing
During the project implementation, you will learn the basics of SQL and work with the H2 database. You will also learn about advanced Java features such as Collections.
